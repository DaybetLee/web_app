## My School Assignment 3

This is my third application demo for my school assignment. The main requirement is to create a web application involving Node.js.

Here are the functionalities associated with the application:

To create an Insurance Policy Management Portal, where member insurance agent can maintain and manage their client’s profile in this website. The client may also log on to this website to have an overview of their insurance coverage from various insurance companies. The web master, may upon request from any lawyer or government authorities to send a link to the client’s administrator with client’s name and authority reference (court order number or death certificate number) and all the policies that the client held. Note that this portal is NOT a document repository.

Specify and construct this portal using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and any backing store you desire (e.g. a database).

Everyone may take up many insurance policies and they are usually not from only one insurance company. When there is a need for such claims, the administrator is usually not be the policy holder. In view of security, only the insurance agent may know the details. Unfortunately, most of the time, the agent may have left the insurance company or even the insurance field!

As such, a portal that can track one’s insurance policies is exceptionally important.

For the participating insurance company administrator, they wish to ….
- Register their agents to the site
- update their agent profile including contact
- in the event an agent resigned, update the contact of next agent taking over and seek the policy owner to grant view rights to the new agent

For the insurance agents, they wish to …
- maintain a list of insurance policies he had closed
- able to view the policies of his clients that is under his care only or given rights to access if he has taken over cases from another agent (but must be from same company).

For the policy owner, he wishes to ...
- Register himself to be a member to the site
- View his insurance profile (with selection options on insurance companies)
- Grant access rights to new agent taking over or just reject with reason

For Web Master, he wishes to …
- Inform insurance companies of the note of disclosure
- Provide a link to view the requested insurance profile

For the claimant administrator, he wish to …
- Receive the link that contains all the policies the claimant’s beneficiary is entitled to claim
